My expertise lies in scientific programming, molecular simulations, data-driven analysis, and effectively communicating complex results through writing and presentations. 

## ðŸŽ“ Background

- Ph.D. in computational Chemistry at the University of Utah 
- B.S. in chemistry from Northern Arizona University

## Core Skills

- Programming & Scripting: Python, Bash, Linux, Slurm, high-performance computing  
- Data Analysis & Visualization: NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Excel  
- Databases & Querying: SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite), CSV parsing, data wrangling  
- Scientific Communication: Technical writing, research presentations, data visualization
- - Molecular Simulations: GROMACS, OpenMM, MDAnalysis  

## Interests

I'm drawn to roles that integrate data analysis, scientific expertise, and effective communication across disciplines.

- Technical writing and documentation
